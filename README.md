_The **.htaccess** file need to be allowed to rewrite your host's one and as a result make your website rootable._

On Apache, find your website's _.conf_ file and find these lines :

  Require all granted
</Directory>```

  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
  AllowOverride All
  Require all granted
</Directory>```

Then apply : `sudo service apache2 restart`.
